As compared with A1/A2/A3, this A4 project has

- NO Setup program to prepare the initial data storage
  structure, and hence no save-to-backup-file needed
  because the app is continuously running all day during
  the updating (inserts, deletes) of the data store.
  Instead, it is created and then used in "UserApp"
  program, (CrowdOrganizerApp) and then disappears when
  the program terminates.

- NO PrettyPrintUtility program since there is no external
  data file storage, nor backup file of the internal
  storage structure that needs to be views and checked.

- NO TestDriver program because it is only a single program
  (UserApp) that needs to be run, and only a single
  transaction test file will be used for A4.

- NO UI class is used in order to simplify the project.
  User interaction is done in the main controller program
