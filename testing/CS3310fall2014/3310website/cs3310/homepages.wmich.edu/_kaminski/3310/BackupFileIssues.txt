Backup file issues:

1) I don't care what the exact details are for the
Backup file in terms of
- text file or binary file
- use <LF>'s or <CR><LF>'s after each line
- use commas (or whatever) between fields
- use fixed-length fields/records instead of
  variable-length fields/records
- dump array to file as a whole or in individual
  records/fields
- . . .
AS LONG AS ALL THESE AGREE AS TO HOW TO HANDLE THINGS
PrettyPrintUtility program
dataTable.DumpToFile
nameIndex.DumpToFile 
dataTable.LoadFromFile
nameIndex.LoadFromFile

The demo specs won't have you actually showing me
what the file looks like - only PrettyPrintUtility
shows me what data is on the file.


2)  You may add an extra field in the "header record"
on Backup file so you have maxIdValue saved (besides n)
so it can be used by PrettyPrintUtility and dataTable
methods like selectAllById.  If you're using static
arrays of size MAX_ARRAY_SIZE = 300, do NOT use the 300
to control your loop, use maxIdValue (so you don't print
out a bunch of empty's).  The only empty's I'd want to
see are the embedded ones like 3,8,15,19,22 when using
A1RawDataSample file (before any INSERT's are done by
UserApp).

You also shouldn't dump all 300 to the Backup file - 
just dump the good-data-section.
