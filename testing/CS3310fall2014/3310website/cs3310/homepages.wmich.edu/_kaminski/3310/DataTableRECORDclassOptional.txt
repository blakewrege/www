Several people have asked whether DataTableRecord class
was really necessary since there's not much really
happening in that class (if reading/writing a RECORD to
the FILE actually got done in the DataTable class).

OK, the DataTableRecord class is optional, if you're
doing all the file/record/field handling for the table
in the DataTable class.
