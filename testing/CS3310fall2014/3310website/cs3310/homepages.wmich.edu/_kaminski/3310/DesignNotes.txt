PROJECT DESIGN NOTES

id, code & name all uniquely identify countries,
  so one is chosen as the PK (PrimaryKey), 
  the others are a CKs (CandidateKeys).
  - Since code is the most commonly used key in
    user queries, code is chosen as the PK.
  - The PK is usually the basis for structuring
    the actual data storage.
  - If users frequently need to access the data
    via a CK, then an index is constructed for that
    key field.
  - A3 users don’t want to do SI, DI, AI,
    so no id index is built.
  - A3 users want to to do SN, DN, AN – so nameIndex
    is needed.

A3 users don’t want to do AC (requiring key-sequential
access), they just want to do SC, DC, IN (random access
choice for structuring the data storage.

A3 users don’t often have queries to access the data
based on id,  population, size, continent or 
lifeExpectancy – so no indexes are constructed for these.
  - For the occasional queries involving these fields, 
    linear search of the data is always feasible (though
    generally has poor performance if relatively few 
    records match the target conditions).
  - For the occasional queries needing the records to 
    appear in key-sequence on one of these fields, 
    sorting is always feasible (though generally with 
    poor performance).
