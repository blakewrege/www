Extra classes, besides the 4 I described in the
project specs, are allowed.  But you MUST have
the 4 classes I described at the very least (besides
the 4 programs I specified).

IF you are implementing dataTable and/or nameIndex
as arrays of objects, then you'd have separate 
classes for DataTableRecord and NameIndexRecord.

RawData might be used for file handling AND record
handling AND field handling for the RawData file's
data.  OR, you might have a physically separate
class for RawDataRecord which RawData (responsible
for FILE handling) uses.

Backup class might be used for dealing with the
Backup file, rather than DataTable and NameIndex
both dealing with that file.
