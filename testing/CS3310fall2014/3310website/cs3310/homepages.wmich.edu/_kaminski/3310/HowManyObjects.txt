How many objects are declared for a type of class:
- RawData (in Setup)
    - only 1 since there's only 1 RawData file
      (used in 1 run of Setup)
- UI (in UserApp)
    - only 1 since there's only 1 TransData
      file and 1 Log file (used in 1 run of
      UserApp)
- DataTable (in Setup, and in UserApp)
    - only 1 since there's only 1 dataTable
- NameIndex (in Setup, and in UserApp)
    - only 1 since there's only 1 nameIndex

And IF YOU USE SEPARATE RECORD CLASSES:
- RawDataRecord (in Setup)
    - only 1 since Setup's using the InputStream
      Processing algorithm where only a SINGLE
      RECORD is ever in memory at one time and
      the input stream is an EXTERNAL FILE
- TransDataRecord (in UserApp
    - only 1 since UserApp's using the InputStream
      Processing algorithm where only a SINGLE
      RECORD is ever in memory at one time and
      the input stream is an EXTERNAL FILE
- DataTableRecord (in DataTable)
    - MANY RECORD OBJECTS since this is an INTERNAL
      table and ALL the records are in memory
      during processing of Setup and UserApp
- NameIndexRecord (in NameIndex)
    - MANY RECORD OBJECTS since this is an INTERNAL
      table and ALL the records are in memory
      during processing of Setup and UserApp
