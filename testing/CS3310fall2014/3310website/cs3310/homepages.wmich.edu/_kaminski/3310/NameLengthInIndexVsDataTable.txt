The name field in the dataTable has been padded or 
   truncated to be EXACTLY 15 characters.
That's because we need fixed-length record LOCATIONS
   necessary for doing Direct Address on a FILE,
   (so might as well have fixed-length RECORDS,
    so might as well have fixed-length FIELDS).
We did NOT need fixed-length record locations for asgn 1
   because the dataTable was internal, using Direct
   Address.  Locations in memory (an array) are specified
   by referring to their subscripts, with the actual 
   "records" being as long as they need to be (using 
   variable-length records/fields).
For a FILE, in Java/C#, you can't just seek to an RRN,
   you have to seek to a byteOffset, since a file is
   "really" (physically, to us as Java/C# application
   programmers) a stream of bytes, physically.  (In other
   languages like COBOL, you could "seek" to the RRN,
   and the mapping to byteOffset is handled for you by
   the system (as Java/C# get for arrays).

--------------------------------------------------------
The Name field in the nameIndex is, however, as long as
   it was in the rawData file, with no padding or
   truncating.
nameIndex is internal, stored in an array(s), so we can
   access records by specifying subscript.
