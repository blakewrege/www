There are NO test cases for duplicate ID's (in either
the A2RawDataSample.csv file nor the IN transactions in
the A2TransData?.txt files).  So you don't have to 
include code for such checking in your program.

Assume some other part of the system (program or 
manual procedure) did the data validation for this!

There are also no test cases for duplicate names.
