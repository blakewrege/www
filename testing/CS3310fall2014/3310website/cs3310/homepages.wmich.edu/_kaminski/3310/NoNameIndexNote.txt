Some people had problems with the BST nameIndex
in A2.  So as to not penalize these people further
in A3, and to reduce the size of A3,

NAME INDEX IS NO LONGER PART OF A3 PROJECT
- no need to build the index (in Setup)
- no need to save/restore the index (Backup file)
    so no need to deal with a binary file here
    (though CountryData is a binary file
- no SN, AN, DN transactions in TransData file
- IN transactions deal with dataTable, but not
    nameIndex
- PrettyPrintUtility won't print the Backup file

--------------------------------
I won't go back and change the specs.
I'll just post this note on the website.
