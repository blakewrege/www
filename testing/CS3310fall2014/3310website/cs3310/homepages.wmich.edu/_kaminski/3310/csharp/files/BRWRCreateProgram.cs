// APPLICATION:  BinRWRandom        PROGRAM:  CreateProgram
// AUTHOR:  D. Kaminski
// DESCRIPTION:  This application creates a binary file which is also a RANDOM ACCESS
//      file (Query uses Random Access).  Create also uses RANDOM ACCESS when inserting
//      records into the file (since the order of the input file is NOT in the order
//      needed to create it using SEQUENTIAL ACCESS).
// RANDOM ACCESS FILE STRUCTURE:  A direct address file structure based on ID as the key.
//      That is, the record with ID 04 goes in location 4 in the file.
// RRN's start with 1, not 0.
