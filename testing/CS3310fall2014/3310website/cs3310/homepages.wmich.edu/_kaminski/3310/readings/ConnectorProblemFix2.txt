A solution for a bug encountered interacting with MySQL
   using Visual Studio (any version from 2005~2012):


When user tries to add "MySQL connection" using "Server Explorer",
    the following 2 bugs might appear:

Bug 1: in "Add Connection" Dialog,
       "MySQL Database" does not appear in the list of "Data Source"

The Fix:  Re-install MySQL .net Connector
    (Delete .net MySQL connector -> Restart PC -> re-install)
*note:  based on my research and trial, does not always work, but worth a try
*note2: if this bug still happens after re-install, go to the steps below

-----
Bug 2: After choosing "MySQL Database",
    in the next dialog where we need to enter information,
    the DIALOG CLOSES when INPUTING ANYTHING 
    (this includes trying to paste information)

-ALTERNATIVE FIX-
1) Go to this link --> http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/
2) At "Select Platform", choose ".NET & mono" and download the file shown
3) Extract the file to a folder (any place that's easy to locate)
4) Now, in visual basic (assuming your project is open),
   right click "References" and click "add Reference"
5) Click "browse",go to the extracted folder at "step 3)",
   open the folder named "v4", choose "mysql.data.dll" and "mysql.web.dll".
6) You can now add the following statement "using MySql.Data.MySqlClient"
   and program normally
