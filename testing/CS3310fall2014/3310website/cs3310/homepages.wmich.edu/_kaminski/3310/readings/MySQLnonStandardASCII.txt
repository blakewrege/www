If countries with non-standard ASCII aren't recognized
(i.e., you don't get 239 countries loaded), one student
found the following would fix the problem:


In MySql 5.5, when opening the command line the
connection defaults to the Character Set utf8
(this can be viewed by typing \s in the command line).
Using "\C latin1" will change the Character set of
the your connection to the server to latin1. Under the
latin1 Character Set a large portion of the
non-standard-ASCII characters will be implicitly
converted to capital versions of stadard-ASCII characters
(É to E). Since the database is created in default utf8
(along with our connection in C#), the non-standar-ASCII
character will still be stored, but for all purposes doing
this will make the two characters indiscernible except
by appearance (All searches for É will redirect to E while
still displaying É in the output).

tl;dr - type "\C latin1" before running the WorldDriver.sql
file
