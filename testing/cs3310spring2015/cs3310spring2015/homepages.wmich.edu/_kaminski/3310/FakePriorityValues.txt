The FakeInputStream file is the same as InputStream file except that a EXTRA field has
been added to each record, a FakePriorityValue.  This file can be used to MANUALLY work
with heaps on paper since the numbers are much smaller than the actual population values
(which must be used in the PROGRAM for the actual PriorityValues.

The FakePriorityValues are 1-72 which correspond to the smallest-to-largest populations.
So, since the magnitude of the populations don't matter, just their relative size, the
1-72 values for the FakePriorityValues will give the same heap results.

But you MUST use the REAL InputStream.csv file for the input to your PROGRAM.
