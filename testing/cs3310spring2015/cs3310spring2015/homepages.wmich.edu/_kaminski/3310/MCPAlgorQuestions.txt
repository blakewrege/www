Minimum Cost Path Algorithm - some things to think about
  in understanding the algorithm
  [some refer to Asgn, some to MCP algor in general with ANY data]

1- What should kalamazoo to kalamazoo result in for the distance?
   the path?  the trace of targets?
2- Would kalamazoo to traverseCity always result in the same distance
   answer as traverseCity to kalamazoo?  Would the route itself
   always be just the reverse?
3- What does the number of nodes in "trace of targets" tell us?
   (in plain English)
4- What's the last city printed out in "trace of targets" when
   going from kalamazoo to traverseCity?
   [Assume there's a valid path between the two].
   Is that guaranteed to be the last one in the trace list?
5- Which is the SECOND city that will print out in the "trace
   of targets" when going from kalamazoo to chicago
   [assuming kalamazoo is FIRST in the list, as start city]?
   1) Plainwell (14 miles north of Kalamazoo)
   2) Coloma (45 minutes drive from Kalamazoo)
   3) Chicago (3 hours away - and the destination)
   4) PawPaw (because it's at least on the way to Chicago)
   5) Gary or Benton Harbor or. . . - could be anything on
      the final finished path to Chicago
   6) could be ANY city in the whole graph (it depends. . .)
6- Will every city on the final route appear in the "trace of
   targets"?
7- Will every city in the "trace of targets" be part of the
   final route?
8- Which module would have the code to printTargetCity:
    1) main (in UserApp program)
    2) getCityName (in MapData class)
    3) loadMapData (in MapData class)
    4) findShortestRoute (in Route class)
    5) initializeArrays (in Route class)
    6) searchForPath (in Route class)
    7) reportAnswers (in Route class)
9- Can you describe what each of these modules does (as if you're
   writing a boxed comment at the top of the module) - in 1 or 2
   sentences?
10- What's a module (in your language)?
11- What's the max size that a typical module should be?
12- What does initializeArrays do in pseudocode?
13- What are the 3 supplemental arrays used in Dijkstra's
    Algorithm called?  [For full credit, apply the "commonly-
    used terminology" rule.  However, a more important rule
    you should always apply is the "same terminology as the
    boss/specs" rule].
14- Given a specific graph, can you show me what the 3 arrays
    would look like AFTER initializeArrays is run.
   -  Do I have to also tell you what startCity is?
   -  Do I also have to tell you what destinationCity is?
15- What's the pseudocode for getRoadDistance(a,b) if the map edges
    were stored as:
   - AdjacencyLists?
   - an internal AdjacencyMatrix?
   - an external AdjacencyMatrix?
16- Could a final answer path ever be just one edge?
