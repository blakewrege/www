TransData?.txt files contain the test data embedded 
amongst notes regarding what case they are testing.

All NON-data start with % in the first column.

So your big SWITCH statement in userApp should
watch for the '%' case and just do nothing with
those lines, as oppsed to 'I', 'D', 'S', 'A' cases
which call appropriate methods in CodeIndex class.
