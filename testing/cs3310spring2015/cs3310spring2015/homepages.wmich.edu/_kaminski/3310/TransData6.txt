% TransData6.txt file for Asgn 2 - test DI, DC, IN
%		(and then SI, SC, AI, AC to see if DI, DC, IN worked)
% NOTE:  DI, DC don't work, per se.  The delete methods in CodeIndex class
%	and in DataStorage class are just DUMMY STUBS (i.e., the methods
%	exist and are call-able, but their code bodies just report to Log
%	file:  "Sorry, this method not yet working").
