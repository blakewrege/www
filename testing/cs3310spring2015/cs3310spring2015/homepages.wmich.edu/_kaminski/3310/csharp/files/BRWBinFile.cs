// APPLICATION:  BinaryReaderWriter         SEPARATE SHARABLE CLASS:  BinFile
// 
// DESCRIPTION:  This class handles the binary file used by the 2 programs.
//      It provides methods for opening the file, closing the file and ReadARec and
//      WriteARec.
// NOTE:  If there were more record/field-handling in this app, then I would have
//      set up a SEPARATE CLASS for BinRec in addition to the BinFile class
//      (as was shown in an earlier example on the course webpage).
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A BINARY FILE:  (read the DumpingABinaryFile.pdf document on the course website)
//      A file is referred to as a "binary file" when it is not a text file
//          (i.e., it doesn't contain only printable ASCII/Unicode characters).
//      A binary file
//          - contains fields which are int/double/. . . (non-char, non-string fields)
//          - does not have a <CR><LF> after each record (which is just a nice-ity for
//              human readers, really)
//          - can use fixed-length or variable-length records, but the program must know
//              how many bytes to read or write.
//              BinaryWriter has a Write method (not WriteLine) to be able to write out
//                  fields of any of the different data types - and since the field is
//                  a parameter, its size (in bytes) can be determined by the method.
//              BinaryReader has ReadInt32, ReadDouble, ReadSingle, . . . ReadChar,
//                  ReadChars(how many?) methods, but does not have a ReadLine method.
//                  The number of bytes is thus specified by the method used.
//      There are 3 TYPES OF BINARY FILES in C#:
//          1) a PC-specific one which can be created with BinaryWriter and read using
//              BinaryReader (DEMONSTRATED IN THIS APP).
//          2) a .NET-specific serialized binary file (shown another example app).
//          3) a generic binary file which can be tailored to be readable using any
//              language/OS/platform (shown in another example app).
//
// VIEWING A BINARY FILE:  A binary file can't just be printed or viewed in NotePad.
//      There are 2 ways to view its contents:
//      1) use a HexEditor (or OS dump utility) - see course website for details.
//      2) write a simple Dump/Display utility program.
//
// A NOTE on STORAGE in a BINARY FILE for THIS TYPE (#1) of binary file
//          - numeric multi-byte fields (int's, double's, float's, . . .) are stored as
//              LITTLE-ENDIAN on the file since that's how they're stored in memory
//              (see course website "Other Issues #4)
//          - string fields are stored with a preceeding 8-bit byte counter
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BINARY FILE here: 
//      - the file name is hard-coded in the constructor, the callers don't supply it
//      - it contains fixed-length records, fixed-length fields, no field-separators
//          and no <LF><CR> (it uses Write, not WriteLine)
//      - contains the same fields in the same order as the input file: id, name, gpa
//      - however, for the binary file:
//              id is stored as an actual int (4 bytes)
//              name is stored as char's, same as the input file
//              gpa is stored as an actual float (4 bytes) with the decimal point
// To view the file,
//      1) run the DisplayProgram
//      2) view it in a HexEditor.  (There's also a pdf of the HexEditor's display - 
//          see "XVII32 - BinaryFile" in the main folder of this app.
