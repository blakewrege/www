// PROGRAM:  UsingFileInputStream
// AUTHOR:  D. Kaminski
// DESCRIPTION:  This demonstrates using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream for 
//      reading and writing text files.
// THE FILES:  InFile and OutFile are sequential access text files.
// THE RECORDS:  Both files have FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS (lines) containing id, name, gpa.
//      However, the field-order is different in the 2 files.
//              InFile:   id (2 char), name (8 char), gpa (4 char) plus &lt;CR>&lt;LF>
//              OutFile:  gpa (4 char), name (8 char), id (2 char) plus &lt;CR>&lt;LF>
//      This means that each input record has to be subdivided into individual fields
//          so as to access the fields, rather than just processing the whole record
//          as a single unit (i.e., aLine).
//          [This is done in order to show how such conversion can be done].
//      However, there was no need to convert the string id and string gpa into int
//          and float fields since no numeric processing needed to be done.
// FILEINPUT/OUTPUTSTREAM:  These class's Read and Write methods access a BYTE ARRAY 
//      rather than a STRING which FileReader and FileWriter use.  Their parameters 
//      include:
//          1) the byte array which will hold the record:       buffer 
//          2) the offset in the buffer:                        0
//          3) the number of bytes to read in or write out:     REC_SIZE
//              (which is 2 + 8 + 4 + the extra 2 for the &lt;CR>&lt;LF>)
// SOME ISSUES WHEN USING FILEINPUTSTREAM:
//      - The byte array (buffer) is generally converted into a string for easier
//          processing of the record's fields.  For example, numeric fields will often
//          need to be converted into int's, float's, etc. for arithmetic processing.
//      - FileInputStream is used here with FIXED-LENGTH records (i.e., every record is
//          exactly REC_SIZE long) rather than VARIABLE-LENGTH records since REC_SIZE
//          must be specified in the Read/Write calls.
//      - Alternatively, if VARIABLE-LENGTH records were used, each data record in the
//          input file would have to be preceeded with a record SIZE field (which would
//          have to be a FIXED-SIZE FIELD) which would have to be read in first, then
//          FileInputStream's Read would use this for its record size parameter.
//          Similarly, the output file would need a preceeding-byte-count for each
//          record if it will later be read using FileInputStream.
//      - The methods are Read and Write, not ReadLine and WriteLine.  So,
//              - when calculating REC_SIZE, the 2 bytes for &lt;CR>&lt;LF> must be included
//              - Read's buffer DOES include the &lt;CR>&lt;LF>
//              - when writing to a file, the &lt;CR>&lt;LF> must be put into the end of the
//                  buffer for a record, if those are to be included in the file.
//                  Since Read's buffer already includes them, they don't need to be
//                  appended for this example
// IMPORTANT NOTE:  It will be necessary to use FileInputStream later for handling
//      RANDOM ACCESS files.  It will also be useful for generic BINARY files.
