HOW TO print integers as 2-columns


For example, we want 25, 7, -1, 0 to print as:
25
07
-1
00

Console.WriteLine("{0:00;-0;00}", theInt);

After the {0: placeHolder there are 3 options:
  (separated by SEMI-COLONS)
  1st one specifies format for positive's:  00
  2nd one specifies format for negative's:  -0
  3rd one specifies format for zeroes:      00

The same format string could be used for:
  string s = string.Format("{0:00;-0;00}", theInt);
