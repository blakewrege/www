Orig.txt file was created in NotePad on a PC.
It was ftp'd from a PC (Windows system) to a webserver
     (a Unix-based system)
  - 1st using ASCII mode  (A mode) -->>  A.txt
  - 2nd using BINARY mode (B mode) -->>  B.txt

ASCII mode transfers a file, CONVERTING IT to the 
      RECEIVING MACHINE'S NATIVE TEXT FILE FORMAT.
  In this case, since it's a Unix system as the recipient
      (which uses a <LF> as the line-separator and not
      <CR><LF> as Windows does), a CONVERSION HAPPENS,
      where \r\n's are replaced with just \n's.

BINARY mode transfers a file EXACTLY AS IS, byte-by-byte.

NOTE:  the default in many ftp apps (like FileZilla) is
  to use "automatic" mode, using A mode for supposedly
  text files - i.e., anything with a file extension of
  .txt .java .cs .sql (etc.) and B mode for all other
  file types.  The list of text file extensions, which
  is changeable, is in the options/settings.
